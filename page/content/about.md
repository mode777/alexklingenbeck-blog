I’m a passionate software developer, always eager to learn new technologies and becoming more proficient in known ones. I’ve mostly worked as a full-stack web developer in an Asp.Net environment, focusing on REST-APIs and Single-Page-Applications. I’m also interested in graphics programming especially in an embedded or web environment. Lately I’ve also become increasingly interested in clean-code and software architecture which is an area I’d like to move towards to.

I'm a computer science student at [TH Nuremberg](http://www.th-nuernberg.de). By . I also work as a software engineer at [endobit software solutions](http://www.endobit.de), where I do full-stack web developement, mostly with Asp.NET WebApi and Kendo UI. I'm also able make architecutral and data-model decisions for new projects.

In my freetime I love to experiment with upcoming web technologies like WebGL and Angular. I also used to do [games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpd5dRqDOe4) but I hardly find the time anymore. My goal for 2017 is to get more into C++ and OpenGL ES2.
