        <p>To be honest, it took me several tries to get this simple blog working. This is kind of embarassing for a web developer, but hear me out! </p>
<p>About half a year ago, I got fed up with using my Raspberry PI with DynDns and got me a vServer and a top-level domain. The main motivation, 
other then hosting all sorts of crazy stuff like <a href="http://alexklingenbeck.de:3000">Gogs</a> and <a href="http://alexklingenbeck.de/kindergarten">random experiments</a>, was to have a personal blog.</p>
<p>For most people this would have been straightforward: Head to tumblr or install wordpress or any other CMS. But this was far too mundane for me. Oh no - it had to be state of the art, and custom-made. </p>
<h2 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h2>
<p>First thing I tried was a Kendo-UI SPA setup I mostly run at work. I made some modifications that quickly escalated into a full-blown framework. Of course this slightly shifted away my focus from the blog, but at least we could use the improvements at work.</p>
<p><strong>First rule:</strong> If you do a project, focus on the project. Don&#39;t get sidetracked, by some seemingly brilliant idea. (This is true for every project, not just programming)</p>
<h2 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, I decided to give the blog another try. This time I decided to use Angular (4) and Asp.net Core. In the former I didn&#39;t have much experience, in the later nobody had much experience at the time. After I dragged myself through the swamp that is Webpack configurations and getting to run asp.net core on linux as well as the question wether to use &quot;project.json&quot; or &quot;*.csproj&quot; and why in the world this even has to be such a big deal, I got the boat floating - beautifully.</p>
<p>Some time later I showed the first prototype to a friend in university, who has a more conservative view on web development. &quot;Why is there a loading screen?&quot; he asked (Answer: 1mb+ payload of Javascript), &quot;What happens if I turn off Javascript?&quot; (Answer: Blank page), &quot;Will this work in IE9?&quot; (Answer: No). Then he showed me his blog, which was just static (Jekyll-generated) HTML, but it was super fast and worked on literally every device capable of rendering HTML. Somehow this &quot;stone-age&quot; technology did a better job than my Angular &quot;rocket-science&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Second rule:</strong> Always find the right technology for the Job. There is no such thing as a <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/golden-hammer">Golden Hammer</a>.</p>
<p>However, I ended up with a nice <a href="https://github.com/mode777/aspnet-angular2-bootstrap">template</a> for future Angular/Asp.Net Core projects.</p>
<h2 id="third-and-final-attempt">Third and final attempt</h2>
<p>So static page generation seemed like the way to go. I probably should have used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or <a href="http://hexo.io">Hexo</a>, but I still wanted it to be custom made. Also this was a welcome oportunity to get a little bit more into Node.js. I figured, I could just collect files from a folder and run them through <a href="http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html">DoT.js</a> templates. Well it turned out to be a little more complex than that and lead to creating a little tool called <a href="https://github.com/mode777/page-gen">page-gen</a>, to finally create the blog. &quot;Wait a minute!&quot; you might say &quot;Creating your own static-page generator. Didn&#39;t you totally get sidetracked again?&quot; Well ...yes, thats why rule three is:</p>
<p><strong>Third rule:</strong> Feel free to break rule one and two, especially for personal projects. Always choosing the easy and obvious option often stops you from learning something new. Also you might discover a new way to solve a problem. Even if the first attempts didn&#39;t lead to anything, I learned a lot in regards to Typescript, Webpack, Asp.NET Core and Angular 2+. And this knowledge might proof to be more valuable than having a niche-blog.  </p>
